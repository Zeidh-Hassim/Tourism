This is a travel-based website designed for travel agents.

1. Clients can sign up and log in.
2. Admins have a separate login, accessible from the footer.
3. Admins can add packages and manage reviews.

Please note that this website is not fully completed. Currently, actual packages have not been created; instead, popular places in Sri Lanka have been listed and connected to the database. Additionally, admins are required to gather reviews from clients through other media and update them through their panel.
